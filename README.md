# Roman_Numerals_Helper

Write two functions that convert a roman numeral to and from an integer value. Multiple roman numeral values will be tested for each function.
Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero.

P.S.: You may paste the code from class Snail_array_class to check it on codewars.com or run the Program.cs with attached class to check it on your PC with your own test strings. P.P.S: Jagged array is used here according to challenge requirements.
